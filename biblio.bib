  abstract        = {The 5' untranslated region (5'UTR) of lentiviral genomic RNA is highly structured, and is the site of multiple RNA-RNA and RNA-protein interactions throughout the viral life cycle. The 5'UTR plays a critical role during transcription, translational regulation, genome dimerization, reverse transcription priming and encapsidation. The 5'UTR structures of human lentiviruses have been extensively studied, yet the respective role and conformation of each domain is still controversial. To gain insight into the structure-function relationship of lentiviral 5'UTRs, we modelled the RNA structure of the feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), a virus that is evolutionarily distant from the primate viruses. Through combined chemical and enzymatic structure probing and a thorough phylogenetic study, we establish a model for the secondary structure of the 5'UTR and Gag coding region. This work highlights properties common to all lentiviruses, like the primer binding site structure and the presence of a stable stem-loop at the 5' extremity. We find that FIV has also evolved specific features, including a long stem loop overlapping the end of the 5'UTR and the beginning of the coding region. In addition, we observed footprints of Gag protein on each side of the initiation codon, this sheds light on the role of the sequences required for encapsidation.},

  abstract        = {Chemical probing of RNA and DNA structure is a widely used and highly informative approach for examining nucleic acid structure and for evaluating interactions with protein and small-molecule ligands. Use of capillary electrophoresis to analyze chemical probing experiments yields hundreds of nucleotides of information per experiment and can be performed on automated instruments. Extraction of the information from capillary electrophoresis electropherograms is a computationally intensive multistep analytical process, and no current software provides rapid, automated, and accurate data analysis. To overcome this bottleneck, we developed a platform-independent, user-friendly software package, QuShape, that yields quantitatively accurate nucleotide reactivity information with minimal user supervision. QuShape incorporates newly developed algorithms for signal decay correction, alignment of time-varying signals within and across capillaries and relative to the RNA nucleotide sequence, and signal scaling across channels or experiments. An analysis-by-reference option enables multiple, related experiments to be fully analyzed in minutes. We illustrate the usefulness and robustness of QuShape by analysis of RNA SHAPE (selective 2'-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension) experiments.},

Modified sites are detected as stops in an optimized primer extension reaction, followed by electrophoretic fragment separation. SHAPE chemistry scores local nucleotide flexibility at all four ribonucleotides in a single experiment and discriminates between base-paired versus unconstrained or flexible residues with a dynamic range of 20-fold or greater. Quantitative SHAPE reactivity information can be used to establish the secondary structure of an RNA, to improve the accuracy of structure prediction algorithms, to monitor structural differences between related RNAs or a single RNA in different states, and to detect ligand binding sites.

Three distinct translation initiation mechanisms ensuring Gag production have been described with little rationale for their multiplicity. The Gag-IRES has the singularity to be located within Gag ORF and to directly interact with ribosomal 40S. Aiming at elucidating the specificity and the relevance of this interaction, we probed HIV-1 Gag-IRES structure and developed an innovative integrative modelling strategy to take into account all the gathered information. We propose a novel Gag-IRES secondary structure strongly supported by all experimental data. We further demonstrate the presence of two regions within Gag-IRES that independently and directly interact with the ribosome. Importantly, these binding sites are functionally relevant to Gag translation both in vitro and ex vivo. This work provides insight into the Gag-IRES molecular mechanism and gives compelling evidence for its physiological importance. It allows us to propose original hypotheses about the IRES physiological role and conservation among primate lentiviruses.},

Mutational profiling (MaP) identifies modified residues by using reverse transcriptase to misread a SHAPE-modified nucleotide and then counting the resulting mutations by massively parallel sequencing. The SHAPE-MaP approach measures the structure of large and transcriptome-wide systems as accurately as can be done for simple model RNAs. This protocol describes the experimental steps, implemented over 3 d, that are required to perform SHAPE probing and to construct multiplexed SHAPE-MaP libraries suitable for deep sequencing. Automated processing of MaP sequencing data is accomplished using two software packages. ShapeMapper converts raw sequencing files into mutational profiles, creates SHAPE reactivity plots and provides useful troubleshooting information. SuperFold uses these data to model RNA secondary structures, identify regions with well-defined structures and visualize probable and alternative helices, often in under 1 d. SHAPE-MaP can be used to make nucleotide-resolution biophysical measurements of individual RNA motifs, rare components of complex RNA ensembles and entire transcriptomes. },

The motifs are often composed of a combination of sequence and structural constraints such that the overall structure is preserved even though much of the primary sequence is variable. While several methods exist to discover transcriptional regulatory sites in the DNA sequences of coregulated genes, the RNA motif discovery problem is much more difficult because of covariation in the positions. We describe the combined use of two approaches for RNA structure prediction, FOLDALIGN and COVE, that together can discover and model stem-loop RNA motifs in unaligned sequences, such as UTRs from post-transcriptionally coregulated genes. We evaluate the method on two datasets, one a section of rRNA genes with randomly truncated ends so that a global alignment is not possible, and the other a hyper-variable collection of IRE-like elements that were inserted into randomized UTR sequences. In both cases the combined method identified the motifs correctly, and in the rRNA example we show that it is capable of determining the structure, which includes bulge and internal loops as well as a variable length hairpin loop. Those automated results are quantitatively evaluated and found to agree closely with structures contained in curated databases, with correlation coefficients up to 0.9. A basic server, Stem-Loop Align SearcH (SLASH), which will perform stem-loop searches in unaligned RNA sequences, is available at http://www.bioinf.au.dk/slash/.},

    Traditional sequence alignment algorithms, however, fail at computing
    reliable alignments of low-homology RNA sequences. The spatial conformation
    of RNA sequences largely determines their function, and therefore
    RNA alignment algorithms have to take structural information into
    account. RESULTS: We present a graph-based representation for sequence-structure
    alignments, which we model as an integer linear program (ILP). We
    sketch how we compute an optimal or near-optimal solution to the
    ILP using methods from combinatorial optimization, and present results
    on a recently published benchmark set for RNA alignments. CONCLUSION:
    The implementation of our algorithm yields better alignments in terms
    of two published scores than the other programs that we tested: This
    is especially the case with an increasing number of input sequences.

abstract = {A dynamic programming algorithm for prediction of RNA secondary structure has been revised to accommodate folding constraints determined by chemical modification and to include free energy increments for coaxial stacking of helices when they are either adjacent or separated by a single mismatch. Furthermore, free energy parameters are revised to account for recent experimental results for terminal mismatches and hairpin, bulge, internal, and multibranch loops. To demonstrate the applicability of this method, in vivo modification was performed on 5S rRNA in both Escherichia coli and Candida albicans with 1-cyclohexyl-3-(2-morpholinoethyl) carbodiimide metho-p-toluene sulfonate, dimethyl sulfate, and kethoxal. The percentage of known base pairs in the predicted structure increased from 26.3{\%} to 86.8{\%} for the E. coli sequence by using modification constraints. For C. albicans, the accuracy remained 87.5{\%} both with and without modification data. On average, for these sequences and a set of 14 sequences with known secondary structure and chemical modification data taken from the literature, accuracy improves from 67{\%} to 76{\%}. This enhancement primarily reflects improvement for three sequences that are predicted with {\textless}40{\%} accuracy on the basis of energetics alone. For these sequences, inclusion of chemical modification constraints improves the average accuracy from 28{\%} to 78{\%}. For the 11 sequences with {\textless}6{\%} pseudoknotted base pairs, structures predicted with constraints from chemical modification contain on average 84{\%} of known canonical base pairs.},

abstract = {An RNA molecule, particularly a long-chain mRNA, may exist as a population of structures. Further more, multiple structures have been demonstrated to play important functional roles. Thus, a representation of the ensemble of probable structures is of interest. We present a statistical algorithm to sample rigorously and exactly from the Boltzmann ensemble of secondary structures. The forward step of the algorithm computes the equilibrium partition functions of RNA secondary structures with recent thermodynamic parameters. Using conditional probabilities computed with the partition functions in a recursive sampling process, the backward step of the algorithm quickly generates a statistically representative sample of structures. With cubic run time for the forward step, quadratic run time in the worst case for the sampling step, and quadratic storage, the algorithm is efficient for broad applicability. We demonstrate that, by classifying sampled structures, the algorithm enables a statistical delineation and representation of the Boltzmann ensemble. Applications of the algorithm show that alternative biological structures are revealed through sampling. Statistical sampling provides a means to estimate the probability of any structural motif, with or without constraints. For example, the algorithm enables probability profiling of single-stranded regions in RNA secondary structure. Probability profiling for specific loop types is also illustrated. By overlaying probability profiles, a mutual accessibility plot can be displayed for predicting RNA:RNA interactions. Boltzmann probability-weighted density of states and free energy distributions of sampled structures can be readily computed. We show that a sample of moderate size from the ensemble of an enormous number of possible structures is sufficient to guarantee statistical reproducibility in the estimates of typical sampling statistics. Our applications suggest that the sampling algorithm may be well suited to prediction of mRNA structure and target accessibility. The algorithm is applicable to the rational design of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), antisense oligonucleotides, and trans-cleaving ribozymes in gene knock-down studies.},

  abstract  = {An algorithm is presented for generating rigorously all suboptimal secondary structures between the minimum free energy and an arbitrary upper limit. The algorithm is particularly fast in the vicinity of the minimum free energy. This enables the efficient approximation of statistical quantities, such as the partition function or measures for structural diversity. The density of states at low energies and its associated structures are crucial in assessing from a thermodynamic point of view how well-defined the ground state is. We demonstrate this by exploring the role of base modification in tRNA secondary structures, both at the level of individual sequences from Escherichia coli and by comparing artificially generated ensembles of modified and unmodified sequences with the same tRNA structure. The two major conclusions are that (1) base modification considerably sharpens the definition of the ground state structure by constraining energetically adjacent structures to be similar to the ground state, and (2) sequences whose ground state structure is thermodynamically well defined show a significant tendency to buffer single point mutations. This can have evolutionary implications, since selection pressure to improve the definition of ground states with biological function may result in increased neutrality.},

  abstract = {RNA secondary structure prediction is widely used for developing hypotheses about the structures of RNA sequences, and structure can provide insight about RNA function. The accuracy of structure prediction is known to be improved using experimental mapping data that provide information about the pairing status of single nucleotides, and these data can now be acquired for whole transcriptomes using high-throughput sequencing. Prior methods for using these experimental data focused on predicting structures for sequences assuming that they populate a single structure. Most RNAs populate multiple structures, however, where the ensemble of strands populates structures with different sets of canonical base pairs. The focus on modeling single structures has been a bottleneck for accurately modeling RNA structure. In this work, we introduce Rsample, an algorithm for using experimental data to predict more than one RNA structure for sequences that populate multiple structures at equilibrium. We demonstrate, using SHAPE mapping data, that we can accurately model RNA sequences that populate multiple structures, including the relative probabilities of those structures. This program is freely available as part of the RNAstructure software package.},

abstract = {Despite the critical roles RNA structures play in regulating gene expression, sequencing-based methods for experimentally determining RNA base pairs have remained inaccurate. Here, we describe a multidimensional chemical-mapping method called "mutate-and-map read out through next-generation sequencing" (M2-seq) that takes advantage of sparsely mutated nucleotides to induce structural perturbations at partner nucleotides and then detects these events through dimethyl sulfate (DMS) probing and mutational profiling. In special cases, fortuitous errors introduced during DNA template preparation and RNA transcription are sufficient to give M2-seq helix signatures; these signals were previously overlooked or mistaken for correlated double-DMS events. When mutations are enhanced through error-prone PCR, in vitro M2-seq experimentally resolves 33 of 68 helices in diverse structured RNAs including ribozyme domains, riboswitch aptamers, and viral RNA domains with a single false positive. These inferences do not require energy minimization algorithms and can be made by either direct visual inspection or by a neural-network-inspired algorithm called M2-net. Measurements on the P4-P6 domain of the Tetrahymena group I ribozyme embedded in Xenopus egg extract demonstrate the ability of M2-seq to detect RNA helices in a complex biological environment.},

abstract = {Almost all RNAs can fold to form extensive base-paired secondary structures. Many of these structures then modulate numerous fundamental elements of gene expression. Deducing these structureâ€“function relationships requires that it be possible to predict RNA secondary structures accurately. However, RNA secondary structure prediction for large RNAs, such that a single predicted structure for a single sequence reliably represents the correct structure, has remained an unsolved problem. Here, we demonstrate that quantitative, nucleotide-resolution information from a SHAPE experiment can be interpreted as a pseudo-free energy change term and used to determine RNA secondary structure with high accuracy. Free energy minimization, by using SHAPE pseudo-free energies, in conjunction with nearest neighbor parameters, predicts the secondary structure of deproteinized 16S rRNA ({\textgreater}1,300 nt) and a set of smaller RNAs (75â€“155 nt) with accuracies of up to 96â€“100{\%}, which are comparable to the best accuracies achievable by comparative sequence analysis.},

abstract = {In a recent publication, we presented a new multiobjective decision-making tool for use in conceptual engineering design. In the present paper, we provide important developments that support the next phase in the evolution of the tool. These developments, together with those of our previous work, provide a concept selection approach that capitalizes on the benefits of computational optimization. Specifically, the new approach uses the efficiency and effectiveness of optimization to rapidly compare numerous designs, and characterize the tradeoff properties within the multiobjective design space. As such, the new approach differs significantly from traditional (non-optimization based) concept selection approaches where, comparatively speaking, significant time is often spent evaluating only a few points in the design space. Under the new approach, design concepts are evaluated using a so-calleds-Pareto frontier; this frontier originates from the Pareto frontiers of various concepts, and is the Pareto frontier for thesetof design concepts. An important characteristic of the s-Pareto frontier is that it provides a foundation for analyzing tradeoffs between design objectives and the tradeoffs between design concepts. The new developments presented in this paper include; (i) the notion ofminimally representingthe s-Pareto frontier, (ii) the quantification of concept goodness using s-Pareto frontiers, (iii) the development of an interactive design space exploration approach that can be used to visualizen-dimensional s-Pareto frontiers, and (iv) s-Pareto frontier-based approaches for considering uncertainty in concept selection. Simple structural examples are presented that illustrate representative applications of the proposed method.},

In particular, both the partition function and the probabilities of all base pairs are computed by a recursive scheme of polynomial order N3 in the sequence length N. The temperature dependence of the partition function gives information about melting behavior for the secondary structure. The pair binding probabilities, the computation of which depends on the partition function, are visually summarized in a "box matrix" display and this provides a useful tool for examining the full ensemble of probable alternative equilibrium structures. The calculation of this ensemble representation allows a proper application and assessment of the predictive power of the secondary structure method, and yields important information on alternatives and intermediates in addition to local information about base pair opening and slippage. The results are illustrated for representative tRNA, 5S RNA, and self-replicating and self-splicing RNA molecules, and allow a direct comparison with enzymatic structure probes. The effect of changes in the thermodynamic parameters on the equilibrium ensemble provides a further sensitivity check to the predictions.},

abstract = {A pseudoknot forms in an RNA when nucleotides in a loop pair with a region outside the helices that close the loop. Pseudoknots occur relatively rarely in RNA but are highly overrepresented in functionally critical motifs in large catalytic RNAs, in riboswitches, and in regulatory elements of viruses. Pseudoknots are usually excluded from RNA structure prediction algorithms. When included, these pairings are difficult to model accurately, especially in large RNAs, because allowing this structure dramatically increases the number of possible incorrect folds and because it is difficult to search the fold space for an optimal structure. We have developed a concise secondary structure modeling approach that combines SHAPE (selective 2'-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension) experimental chemical probing information and a simple, but robust, energy model for the entropic cost of single pseudoknot formation. Structures are predicted with iterative refinement, using a dynamic programming algorithm. This melded experimental and thermodynamic energy function predicted the secondary structures and the pseudoknots for a set of 21 challenging RNAs of known structure ranging in size from 34 to 530 nt. On average, 93{\%} of known base pairs were predicted, and all pseudoknots in well-folded RNAs were identified.},

abstract = {Free energy minimization has been the most popular method for RNA secondary structure prediction for decades. It is based on a set of empirical free energy change parameters derived from experiments using a nearest-neighbor model. In this study, a program, MaxExpect, that predicts RNA secondary structure by maximizing the expected base-pair accuracy, is reported. This approach was first pioneered in the program CONTRAfold, using pair probabilities predicted with a statistical learning method. Here, a partition function calculation that utilizes the free energy change nearest-neighbor parameters is used to predict base-pair probabilities as well as probabilities of nucleotides being single-stranded. MaxExpect predicts both the optimal structure (having highest expected pair accuracy) and suboptimal structures to serve as alternative hypotheses for the structure. Tested on a large database of different types of RNA, the maximum expected accuracy structures are, on average, of higher accuracy than minimum free energy structures. Accuracy is measured by sensitivity, the percentage of known base pairs correctly predicted, and positive predictive value (PPV), the percentage of predicted pairs that are in the known structure. By favoring double-strandedness or single-strandedness, a higher sensitivity or PPV of prediction can be favored, respectively. Using MaxExpect, the average PPV of optimal structure is improved from 66{\%} to 68{\%} at the same sensitivity level (73{\%}) compared with free energy minimization.},

The average accuracy for 1000 data-directed predictions always improves over the original minimum free energy (MFE) structure. However, the amount of improvement varies with the sequence, exhibiting a correlation with MFE accuracy. Further analysis of this correlation shows that accurate MFE base pairs are typically preserved in a data-directed prediction, whereas inaccurate ones are not. Thus, the positive predictive value of common base pairs is consistently higher than the directed prediction accuracy. Finally, we confirm sequence dependencies in the directability of thermodynamic predictions and investigate the potential for greater accuracy improvements in the worst performing test sequence.},

We describe the crystal structures of the precleavage and postcleavage LC ribozymes, which suggest that structural features inherited from group I ribozymes have undergone speciation due to profound changes in molecular selection pressure, ultimately giving rise to an original branching ribozyme family. The structures elucidate the role of key elements that regulate the activity of the LC ribozyme by conformational switching and suggest a mechanism by which the signal for branching is transmitted to the catalytic core. The structures also show how conserved interactions twist residues, forming the lariat to join chemical groups involved in branching.},

However, even the classic transfer RNA structure contains features that are overlooked by existing bioinformatics tools. Here we present DSSR (Dissecting the Spatial Structure of RNA), an integrated and automated tool for analyzing and annotating RNA tertiary structures. The software identifies canonical and noncanonical base pairs, including those with modified nucleotides, in any tautomeric or protonation state. DSSR detects higher-order coplanar base associations, termed multiplets. It finds arrays of stacked pairs, classifies them by base-pair identity and backbone connectivity, and distinguishes a stem of covalently connected canonical pairs from a helix of stacked pairs of arbitrary type/linkage. DSSR identifies coaxial stacking of multiple stems within a single helix and lists isolated canonical pairs that lie outside of a stem. The program characterizes 'closed' loops of various types (hairpin, bulge, internal, and junction loops) and pseudoknots of arbitrary complexity. Notably, DSSR employs isolated pairs and the ends of stems, whether pseudoknotted or not, to define junction loops. This new, inclusive definition provides a novel perspective on the spatial organization of RNA. Tests on all nucleic acid structures in the Protein Data Bank confirm the efficiency and robustness of the software, and applications to representative RNA molecules illustrate its unique features.

Furthermore, target RNA structure is an important consideration in the design of small interfering RNAs and antisense DNA oligonucleotides.

RESULTS: RNAstructure is a software package for RNA secondary structure prediction and analysis. It uses thermodynamics and utilizes the most recent set of nearest neighbor parameters from the Turner group. It includes methods for secondary structure prediction (using several algorithms), prediction of base pair probabilities, bimolecular structure prediction, and prediction of a structure common to two sequences. This contribution describes new extensions to the package, including a library of C++ classes for incorporation into other programs, a user-friendly graphical user interface written in JAVA, and new Unix-style text interfaces. The original graphical user interface for Microsoft Windows is still maintained. CONCLUSION: The extensions to RNAstructure serve to make RNA secondary structure prediction user-friendly.

Statistical analysis of the frequencies of RT-stops and RT-mutations can then be used to estimate a measure of chemical probing reactivity at each nucleotide of an RNA, which reveals properties of the underlying RNA structure. Inspired by recent work that showed that different reverse transcriptase enzymes show distinct biases for detecting adducts as either RT-stops or RT-mutations, here we use a statistical modeling framework to derive an equation for chemical probing reactivity using experimental signatures from both RT-stops and RT-mutations within a single experiment. The resulting formula intuitively matches the expected result from considering reactivity to be defined as the fraction of adduct observed at each position in an RNA at the end of a chemical probing experiment.

  abstract = {Structure dictates the function of many RNAs, but secondary RNA structure analysis is either labor intensive and costly or relies on computational predictions that are often inaccurate. These limitations are alleviated by integration of structure probing data into prediction algorithms. However, existing algorithms are optimized for a specific type of probing data. Recently, new chemistries combined with advances in sequencing have facilitated structure probing at unprecedented scale and sensitivity. These novel technologies and anticipated wealth of data highlight a need for algorithms that readily accommodate more complex and diverse input sources. We implemented and investigated a recently outlined probabilistic framework for RNA secondary structure prediction and extended it to accommodate further refinement of structural information. This framework utilizes direct likelihood-based calculations of pseudo-energy terms per considered structural context and can readily accommodate diverse data types and complex data dependencies. We use real data in conjunction with simulations to evaluate performances of several implementations and to show that proper integration of structural contexts can lead to improvements. Our tests also reveal discrepancies between real data and simulations, which we show can be alleviated by refined modeling. We then propose statistical preprocessing approaches to standardize data interpretation and integration into such a generic framework. We further systematically quantify the information content of data subsets, demonstrating that high reactivities are major drivers of SHAPE-directed predictions and that better understanding of less informative reactivities is key to further improvements. Finally, we provide evidence for the adaptive capability of our framework using mock probe simulations.},

  abstract = {Recently, several experimental techniques have emerged for probing RNA structures based on high-throughput sequencing. However, most secondary structure prediction tools that incorporate probing data are designed and optimized for particular types of experiments. For example, RNAstructure-Fold is optimized for SHAPE data, while SeqFold is optimized for PARS data. Here, we report a new RNA secondary structure prediction method, restrained MaxExpect (RME), which can incorporate multiple types of experimental probing data and is based on a free energy model and an MEA (maximizing expected accuracy) algorithm. We first demonstrated that RME substantially improved secondary structure prediction with perfect restraints (base pair information of known structures). Next, we collected structure-probing data from diverse experiments (e.g. SHAPE, PARS and DMS-seq) and transformed them into a unified set of pairing probabilities with a posterior probabilistic model. By using the probability scores as restraints in RME, we compared its secondary structure prediction performance with two other well-known tools, RNAstructure-Fold (based on a free energy minimization algorithm) and SeqFold (based on a sampling algorithm). For SHAPE data, RME and RNAstructure-Fold performed better than SeqFold, because they markedly altered the energy model with the experimental restraints. For high-throughput data (e.g. PARS and DMS-seq) with lower probing efficiency, the secondary structure prediction performances of the tested tools were comparable, with performance improvements for only a portion of the tested RNAs. However, when the effects of tertiary structure and protein interactions were removed, RME showed the highest prediction accuracy in the DMS-accessible regions by incorporating in vivo DMS-seq data.},

  abstract = {Chemical and enzymatic footprinting experiments, such as shape (selective 2'-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension), yield important information about RNA secondary structure. Indeed, since the [Formula: see text]-hydroxyl is reactive at flexible (loop) regions, but unreactive at base-paired regions, shape yields quantitative data about which RNA nucleotides are base-paired. Recently, low error rates in secondary structure prediction have been reported for three RNAs of moderate size, by including base stacking pseudo-energy terms derived from shape data into the computation of minimum free energy secondary structure. Here, we describe a novel method, RNAsc (RNA soft constraints), which includes pseudo-energy terms for each nucleotide position, rather than only for base stacking positions. We prove that RNAsc is self-consistent, in the sense that the nucleotide-specific probabilities of being unpaired in the low energy Boltzmann ensemble always become more closely correlated with the input shape data after application of RNAsc. From this mathematical perspective, the secondary structure predicted by RNAsc should be 'correct', in as much as the shape data is 'correct'. We benchmark RNAsc against the previously mentioned method for eight RNAs, for which both shape data and native structures are known, to find the same accuracy in 7 out of 8 cases, and an improvement of 25{\%} in one case. Furthermore, we present what appears to be the first direct comparison of shape data and in-line probing data, by comparing yeast asp-tRNA shape data from the literature with data from in-line probing experiments we have recently performed. With respect to several criteria, we find that shape data appear to be more robust than in-line probing data, at least in the case of asp-tRNA.},

  abstract = {Thermodynamic folding algorithms and structure probing experiments are commonly used to determine the secondary structure of RNAs. Here we propose a formal framework to reconcile information from both prediction algorithms and probing experiments. The thermodynamic energy parameters are adjusted using 'pseudo-energies' to minimize the discrepancy between prediction and experiment. Our framework differs from related approaches that used pseudo-energies in several key aspects. (i) The energy model is only changed when necessary and no adjustments are made if prediction and experiment are consistent. (ii) Pseudo-energies remain biophysically interpretable and hold positional information where experiment and model disagree. (iii) The whole thermodynamic ensemble of structures is considered thus allowing to reconstruct mixtures of suboptimal structures from seemingly contradicting data. (iv) The noise of the energy model and the experimental data is explicitly modeled leading to an intuitive weighting factor through which the problem can be seen as folding with 'soft' constraints of different strength. We present an efficient algorithm to iteratively calculate pseudo-energies within this framework and demonstrate how this approach can be used in combination with SHAPE chemical probing data to improve secondary structure prediction. We further demonstrate that the pseudo-energies correlate with biophysical effects that are known to affect RNA folding such as chemical nucleotide modifications and protein binding.},

  abstract = {In a recent publication, we presented a new multiobjective decision-making tool for use in conceptual engineering design. In the present paper, we provide important developments that support the next phase in the evolution of the tool. These developments, together with those of our previous work, provide a concept selection approach that capitalizes on the benefits of computational optimization. Specifically, the new approach uses the efficiency and effectiveness of optimization to rapidly compare numerous designs, and characterize the tradeoff properties within the multiobjective design space. As such, the new approach differs significantly from traditional (non-optimization based) concept selection approaches where, comparatively speaking, significant time is often spent evaluating only a few points in the design space. Under the new approach, design concepts are evaluated using a so-calleds-Pareto frontier; this frontier originates from the Pareto frontiers of various concepts, and is the Pareto frontier for thesetof design concepts. An important characteristic of the s-Pareto frontier is that it provides a foundation for analyzing tradeoffs between design objectives and the tradeoffs between design concepts. The new developments presented in this paper include; (i) the notion ofminimally representingthe s-Pareto frontier, (ii) the quantification of concept goodness using s-Pareto frontiers, (iii) the development of an interactive design space exploration approach that can be used to visualizen-dimensional s-Pareto frontiers, and (iv) s-Pareto frontier-based approaches for considering uncertainty in concept selection. Simple structural examples are presented that illustrate representative applications of the proposed method.},

For this reason, it has been a recurrent target for in vitro molecular evolution techniques. The exploration of ATP-binding motifs constitutes both an important step in investigating the plausibility of the 'RNA world' hypothesis and a central starting point for the development of new enzymes. To date, only two RNA motifs that bind ATP have been characterized. The first one is targeted to the adenosine moiety, while the second one recognizes the 'Hoogsteen' face of the base. To isolate aptamers that bind ATP in different orientations, we selected RNAs on an affinity resin that presents ATP in three different orientations. We obtained five new motifs that were characterized and subsequently submitted to a secondary selection protocol designed to isolate aptamers specific for cordycepin. Interestingly, all the ATP-binding motifs selected specifically recognize the sugar-phosphate backbone region of the nucleotides. Three of the aptamers show some selectivity for adenine derivatives, while the remainder recognize any of the four nucleotides with similar efficiency. The characteristics of these aptamers are discussed along with implications for in vitro molecular evolution.},

The second approach is based on primer extension by reverse transcriptase and detects stops of transcription at modified or cleaved nucleotides.

Selective 2'-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension (SHAPE) chemistry is a powerful approach for measuring nucleotide structure and dynamics in diverse biological environments. SHAPE reagents acylate the 2'-hydroxyl group at flexible nucleotides because unconstrained nucleotides preferentially sample rare conformations that enhance the nucleophilicity of the 2'-hydroxyl. The critical corollary is that some constrained nucleotides must be poised for efficient reaction at the 2'-hydroxyl group. To identify such nucleotides, we performed SHAPE on intact crystals of the Escherichia coli ribosome, monitored the reactivity of 1490 nucleotides in 16S rRNA, and examined those nucleotides that were hyper-reactive toward SHAPE and had well-defined crystallographic conformations. Analysis of these conformations revealed that 2'-hydroxyl reactivity is broadly facilitated by general base catalysis involving multiple RNA functional groups and by two specific orientations of the bridging 3'-phosphate group. Nucleotide analog studies confirmed the contributions of these mechanisms to SHAPE reactivity. These results provide a strong mechanistic explanation for the relationship between SHAPE reactivity and local RNA dynamics and will facilitate interpretation of SHAPE information in the many technologies that make use of this chemistry.},

The model starts from RNA structures and combines nucleotide interaction strength and conformational propensity, ligand (SHAPE reagent) accessibility, and base-pairing pattern through a composite function to quantify the correlation between SHAPE reactivity and nucleotide conformational stability. The 3DSSR model shows the relationship between SHAPE reactivity and RNA structure and energetics. Comparisons between the 3DSSR-predicted SHAPE profile and the experimental SHAPE data show correlation, suggesting that the extracted analytical function may have captured the key factors that determine the SHAPE reactivity profile.

  abstract        = {The functions of most RNA molecules are critically dependent on the distinct local dynamics that characterize secondary structure and tertiary interactions and on structural changes that occur upon binding by proteins and small molecule ligands. Measurements of RNA dynamics at nucleotide resolution set the foundation for understanding the roles of individual residues in folding, catalysis, and ligand recognition. In favorable cases, local order in small RNAs can be quantitatively analyzed by NMR in terms of a generalized order parameter, S2. Alternatively, SHAPE (selective 2'-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension) chemistry measures local nucleotide flexibility in RNAs of any size using structure-sensitive reagents that acylate the 2'-hydroxyl position. In this work, we compare per-residue RNA dynamics, analyzed by both S2 and SHAPE, for three RNAs: the HIV-1 TAR element, the U1A protein binding site, and the Tetrahymena telomerase stem loop 4. We find a very strong correlation between the two measurements: nucleotides with high SHAPE reactivities consistently have low S2 values. We conclude that SHAPE chemistry quantitatively reports local nucleotide dynamics and can be used with confidence to analyze dynamics in large RNAs, RNA-protein complexes, and RNAs in vivo.},

  abstract        = {Many RNA structures are composed of simple secondary structure elements linked by a few critical tertiary interactions. SHAPE chemistry has made interrogation of RNA dynamics at single-nucleotide resolution straightforward. However, de novo identification of nucleotides involved in tertiary interactions remains a challenge. Here we show that nucleotides that form noncanonical or tertiary contacts can be detected by comparing information obtained using two SHAPE reagents, N-methylisatoic anhydride (NMIA) and 1-methyl-6-nitroisatoic anhydride (1M6). Nucleotides that react preferentially with NMIA exhibit slow local nucleotide dynamics and usually adopt the less common C2'-endo ribose conformation. Experiments and first-principles calculations show that 1M6 reacts preferentially with nucleotides in which one face of the nucleobase allows an unhindered stacking interaction with the reagent. Differential SHAPE reactivities were used to detect noncanonical and tertiary interactions in four RNAs with diverse structures and to identify preformed noncanonical interactions in partially folded RNAs. Differential SHAPE reactivity analysis will enable experimentally concise, large-scale identification of tertiary structure elements and ligand binding sites in complex RNAs and in diverse biological environments.},

Our results confirm the existence of four short helices (3 to 6 bp) within the ribozyme-substrate complex, and demonstrate that one intramolecular helix (helix 4) is comprised of three base-pairs rather than the previously suggested five. In the absence of magnesium, the ribozyme is observed to fold into its secondary structure. Upon addition of magnesium, a striking difference in chemical modification is observed, particularly at sites within the ribozyme's large internal loop (loop B) that are essential for catalytic function (bases 21 to 26). Moreover, magnesium-dependent folding clearly destabilizes an A-U base-pair in a region where a proposed bend is required to juxtapose the catalytically essential loops A and B. Upon addition of substrate, no changes are observed in the structure of helix 3, loop B or helix 4. However, strong protection of bases in the substrate-binding domain is observed, including those located across internal loop A. The modification data are consistent with the formation of a previously proposed tertiary structure motif within loop B that includes non-canonical G-A, A-U and A-A base-pairs, and that is identical with those identified by NMR analysis of loop E of 5 S rRNA and the sarcin/ricin loop of 28 S rRNA. Our results indicate that the hairpin ribozyme adopts a stable magnesium-dependent tertiary structure to which the substrate binds without inducing major conformational changes, and that substrate recognition is likely to involve non-canonical base-pairs between the ribozyme and substrate sequences adjacent to the cleavage site.},

We report herein that high-throughput chemical experiments can isolate an RNA's multiple alternative secondary structures as they are stabilized by systematic mutagenesis (mutate-and-map, M2) and that a computational algorithm, REEFFIT, enables unbiased reconstruction of these states' structures and populations. In an in silico benchmark on non-coding RNAs with complex landscapes, M2-REEFFIT recovers 95% of RNA helices present with at least 25% population while maintaining a low false discovery rate (10%) and conservative error estimates. In experimental benchmarks, M2-REEFFIT recovers the structure landscapes of a 35-nt MedLoop hairpin, a 110-nt 16S rRNA four-way junction with an excited state, a 25-nt bistable hairpin, and a 112-nt three-state adenine riboswitch with its expression platform, molecules whose characterization previously required expert mutational analysis and specialized NMR or chemical mapping experiments. With this validation, M2-REEFFIT enabled tests of whether artificial RNA sequences might exhibit complex landscapes in the absence of explicit design. An artificial flavin mononucleotide riboswitch and a randomly generated RNA sequence are found to interconvert between three or more states, including structures for which there was no design, but that could be stabilized through mutations. These results highlight the likely pervasiveness of rich landscapes with multiple secondary structures in both natural and artificial RNAs and demonstrate an automated chemical/computational route for their empirical characterization.},

  abstract        = {Cricket paralysis virus (CrPV) is a dicistrovirus. Its positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome contains two internal ribosomal entry sites (IRESs). The 5' untranslated region (5'UTR) IRES5'UTR mediates translation of non-structural proteins encoded by ORF1 whereas the well-known intergenic region (IGR) IRESIGR is required for translation of structural proteins from open reading frame 2 in the late phase of infection. Concerted action of both IRES is essential for host translation shut-off and viral translation. IRESIGR has been extensively studied, in contrast the IRES5'UTR remains largely unexplored. Here, we define the minimal IRES element required for efficient translation initiation in drosophila S2 cell-free extracts. We show that IRES5'UTR promotes direct recruitment of the ribosome on the cognate viral AUG start codon without any scanning step, using a Hepatitis-C virus-related translation initiation mechanism. Mass spectrometry analysis revealed that IRES5'UTR recruits eukaryotic initiation factor 3, confirming that it belongs to type III class of IRES elements. Using Selective 2'-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension and DMS probing, we established a secondary structure model of 5'UTR and of the minimal IRES5'UTR. The IRES5'UTR contains a pseudoknot structure that is essential for proper folding and ribosome recruitment. Overall, our results pave the way for studies addressing the synergy and interplay between the two IRES from CrPV.},

The sites of reaction were identified by primer extension with reverse transcriptase using synthetic oligodeoxynucleotide primers. These results provide a detailed and rigorous experimental test of a model for 16 S rRNA secondary structure, which was derived mainly from comparative sequence analysis. Our data also provide information relevant to tertiary and quaternary structure of 16 S rRNA. Data obtained with naked 16 S rRNA show reasonably close agreement with the proposed model, and data obtained with 30 S subunits show nearly complete agreement. Apart from an apparent overall "tightening" of the structure (in which many weakly reactive bases become unreactive), assembly of the proteins with 16 S rRNA to form 30 S subunits brings about numerous local structural rearrangements, resulting in specific enhancements as well as protections. In many instances, the ribosomal proteins appear to "tune" the 16 S rRNA structure to bring it into accordance with the phylogenetically predicted model, even though the RNA on its own often seems to prefer a different structure in certain regions of the molecule. Extensive protection of conserved, unpaired adenines upon formation of 30 S subunits suggests that they play a special role in the assembly process, possibly providing signals for protein recognition.},

The accessibility of both RNAs towards single-strand specific nucleases (T1, T2, A and S1) and a helix-specific ribonuclease from cobra venom (RNase V1) was determined. The reactivity of nucleobase N7, N3 and N1 positions towards chemical probes was investigated under native (5 mM MgCl2, 100 mM KCl, 20 degrees C) and semi-denaturing (1 mM EDTA, 20 degrees C) conditions. Ethylnitrosourea was used to identify phosphates not reactive towards alkylation under native conditions. The results obtained confirm the presence of the five helical stems predicted by the consensus secondary structure model of 5S rRNA. The chemical reactivity data indicate that loops C and D are involved in a number of tertiary interactions, and loop E folds into an unusual secondary structure. A comparison of the data obtained for the two types of Xenopus 5S rRNA indicates that the conformations of the oocyte and somatic 5S rRNAs are very similar. However, the data obtained with nucleases under native conditions, and chemical probes under semi-denaturing conditions, reveal that helices III and IV in the somatic 5S rRNA are less stable than the same structures in oocyte 5S rRNA. Using chimeric 5S rRNAs, it was possible to demonstrate that the relative resistance of oocyte 5S rRNA to partial denaturation in 4 M urea is conferred by the five oocyte-specific nucleotide substitutions in loop B/helix III. In contrast, the superior stability of oocyte 5S rRNA in the presence of EDTA is related to a single C substitution at position 79.},

To gain insights into the molecular mechanisms of HOTAIR, we purified it in a stable and homogenous form in vitro, and we determined its functional secondary structure through chemical probing and phylogenetic analysis. The HOTAIR structure reveals a degree of structural organization comparable to well-folded RNAs, like the group II intron, rRNA, or lncRNA steroid receptor activator. It is composed of four independently folding modules, two of which correspond to predicted protein-binding domains. Secondary structure elements that surround protein-binding motifs are evolutionarily conserved.

Here, we report that translation of the genomic RNA of human immunodeficiency virus type 2 takes place by attachment of the 48S ribosomal preinitiation complex to the coding region, with no need for an upstream 5' untranslated RNA sequence. This unusual mechanism is mediated by an RNA sequence that has features of an IRES with the unique ability to recruit ribosomes upstream from its core domain. A combination of translation assays and structural studies reveal that sequences located 50 nucleotides downstream of the AUG codon are crucial for IRES activity.},

  abstract        = {Insight into the three-dimensional architecture of RNA is essential for understanding its cellular functions. However, even the classic transfer RNA structure contains features that are overlooked by existing bioinformatics tools. Here we present DSSR (Dissecting the Spatial Structure of RNA), an integrated and automated tool for analyzing and annotating RNA tertiary structures. The software identifies canonical and noncanonical base pairs, including those with modified nucleotides, in any tautomeric or protonation state. DSSR detects higher-order coplanar base associations, termed multiplets. It finds arrays of stacked pairs, classifies them by base-pair identity and backbone connectivity, and distinguishes a stem of covalently connected canonical pairs from a helix of stacked pairs of arbitrary type/linkage. DSSR identifies coaxial stacking of multiple stems within a single helix and lists isolated canonical pairs that lie outside of a stem. The program characterizes 'closed' loops of various types (hairpin, bulge, internal, and junction loops) and pseudoknots of arbitrary complexity. Notably, DSSR employs isolated pairs and the ends of stems, whether pseudoknotted or not, to define junction loops. This new, inclusive definition provides a novel perspective on the spatial organization of RNA. Tests on all nucleic acid structures in the Protein Data Bank confirm the efficiency and robustness of the software, and applications to representative RNA molecules illustrate its unique features. DSSR and related materials are freely available at http://x3dna.org/. },

Thus there is a growing need to develop technologies that enable rapid characterization of structural features within complex RNA populations. We have developed a high-throughput technique, SHAPE-Seq, that can simultaneously measure quantitative, single nucleotide-resolution secondary and tertiary structural information for hundreds of RNA molecules of arbitrary sequence. SHAPE-Seq combines selective 2'-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension (SHAPE) chemistry with multiplexed paired-end deep sequencing of primer extension products. This generates millions of sequencing reads, which are then analyzed using a fully automated data analysis pipeline, based on a rigorous maximum likelihood model of the SHAPE-Seq experiment. We demonstrate the ability of SHAPE-Seq to accurately infer secondary and tertiary structural information, detect subtle conformational changes due to single nucleotide point mutations, and simultaneously measure the structures of a complex pool of different RNA molecules. SHAPE-Seq thus represents a powerful step toward making the study of RNA secondary and tertiary structures high throughput and accessible to a wide array of scientific pursuits, from fundamental biological investigations to engineering RNA for synthetic biological systems.},

  abstract        = {RNA-Puzzles is a collective experiment in blind 3D RNA structure prediction. We report here a third round of RNA-Puzzles. Five puzzles, 4, 8, 12, 13, 14, all structures of riboswitch aptamers and puzzle 7, a ribozyme structure, are included in this round of the experiment. The riboswitch structures include biological binding sites for small molecules ( -adenosyl methionine, cyclic diadenosine monophosphate, 5-amino 4-imidazole carboxamide riboside 5'-triphosphate, glutamine) and proteins (YbxF), and one set describes large conformational changes between ligand-free and ligand-bound states. The Varkud satellite ribozyme is the most recently solved structure of a known large ribozyme. All puzzles have established biological functions and require structural understanding to appreciate their molecular mechanisms. Through the use of fast-track experimental data, including multidimensional chemical mapping, and accurate prediction of RNA secondary structure, a large portion of the contacts in 3D have been predicted correctly leading to similar topologies for the top ranking predictions. Template-based and homology-derived predictions could predict structures to particularly high accuracies. However, achieving biological insights from de novo prediction of RNA 3D structures still depends on the size and complexity of the RNA. Blind computational predictions of RNA structures already appear to provide useful structural information in many cases. Similar to the previous RNA-Puzzles Round II experiment, the prediction of non-Watson-Crick interactions and the observed high atomic clash scores reveal a notable need for an algorithm of improvement. All prediction models and assessment results are available at http://ahsoka.u-strasbg.fr/rnapuzzles/.},

Some elements of the environment of the RNA molecule must be altered systematically. Knowledge of the effects of ions or other interacting factors on the activity or physical parameters (e.g., NMR and melting cooperativity) of the RNA help in experimental design. For example, the copious work on tRNA(Phe) compared the crystal and solution structures and allowed the direct correlation of Mg2+ stabilization of the tertiary structure of that molecule. Figure 3 demonstrates that pre-tRNA(Leu-3) responds to Mg2+ depletion in the same manner as detected by the appearance of highly sensitive RNase cleavage sites in the D and T psi C loops. Similar experiments titrating polyamine concentrations suggested that secondary structure was more efficiently stabilized by polyamines than by Mg2+. The variation of Mg2+ concentrations has been used to gain additional information about other RNA structures. Others have used protein-RNA interactions to approach the question of the functional structure of a RNA (for examples, see Ref. 3). Thus, the ideal parameters to choose would be those known to affect the function of the RNA. The variation of Mg2+ and polyamine concentrations would minimally suggest regions of greater or lesser secondary or tertiary structure stability.},

Here we describe a dynamic programming approach for model-free sequence comparison that incorporates high-throughput chemical probing data. Based on SHAPE probing data alone, ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) from three diverse organisms--the eubacteria E. coli and C. difficile and the archeon H. volcanii--could be aligned with accuracies comparable to alignments based on actual sequence identity. When both base sequence identity and chemical probing reactivities were considered together, accuracies improved further. Derived sequence alignments and chemical probing data from protein-free RNAs were then used as pseudo-free energy constraints to model consensus secondary structures for the 16S and 23S rRNAs. There are critical differences between these experimentally-informed models and currently accepted models, including in the functionally important neck and decoding regions of the 16S rRNA. We infer that the 16S rRNA has evolved to undergo large-scale changes in base pairing as part of ribosome function. As high-quality RNA probing data become widely available, structurally-informed sequence alignment will become broadly useful for de novo motif and function discovery.},

Electrophilic SHAPE reagents create adducts at the 2'-hydroxyl position on the RNA backbone of flexible ribonucleotides with relatively little dependence on nucleotide identity. Strategies for adduct detection such as mutational profiling (MaP) allow accurate, automated calculation of relative adduct frequencies for each nucleotide in a given RNA or group of RNAs. A number of alternative reagents and adduct detection strategies have been proposed, especially for use in living cells. Here we evaluate five SHAPE reagents: three previously well-validated reagents 1M7 (1-methyl-7-nitroisatoic anhydride), 1M6 (1-methyl-6-nitroisatoic anhydride), and NMIA ( N-methylisatoic anhydride), one more recently proposed NAI (2-methylnicotinic acid imidazolide), and one novel reagent 5NIA (5-nitroisatoic anhydride). We clarify the importance of carefully designed software in reading out SHAPE experiments using massively parallel sequencing approaches. We examine SHAPE modification in living cells in diverse cell lines, compare MaP and reverse transcription-truncation as SHAPE adduct detection strategies, make recommendations for SHAPE reagent choice, and outline areas for future development.},

  abstract        = {RNA secondary structure modeling is a challenging problem, and recent successes have raised the standards for accuracy, consistency, and tractability. Large increases in accuracy have been achieved by including data on reactivity toward chemical probes: Incorporation of 1M7 SHAPE reactivity data into an mfold-class algorithm results in median accuracies for base pair prediction that exceed 90%. However, a few RNA structures are modeled with significantly lower accuracy. Here, we show that incorporating differential reactivities from the NMIA and 1M6 reagents--which detect noncanonical and tertiary interactions--into prediction algorithms results in highly accurate secondary structure models for RNAs that were previously shown to be difficult to model. For these RNAs, 93% of accepted canonical base pairs were recovered in SHAPE-directed models. Discrepancies between accepted and modeled structures were small and appear to reflect genuine structural differences. Three-reagent SHAPE-directed modeling scales concisely to structurally complex RNAs to resolve the in-solution secondary structure analysis problem for many classes of RNA.},
